# Installation

Clone the git libary or download


Install expo client GLOBAL (if you dont have it already)
```bash
npm install -- global expo-cli
```


Ensure expo is installed with 
```bash
expo --version
```

Then run expo install for the rest of the required dependencies based on the project
```bash
 expo install
```
npm install also works here
```bash
npm install
```


Then if everything went okay the application should run within expo using
```bash
  expo start
```
